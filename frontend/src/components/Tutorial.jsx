      <h1>Hi, Welcome to flex_records tuturial page</h1>

      <p>
        Flex_records by design aims to make carrying out tabular computations
        very easy, as such there are two ways by which computations can be
        achieved.
      </p>

      <p>
        * Granular selection: By clicking on the ùëì button beside any cell (the
        target cell where computation result will be stored), you will be given
        the chance to choose cells horizontally or vertically beside the target
        cell, after which these selected cells will be used as the input to the
        function you select afterwards and the result will be placed in the
        target cell.
      </p>

      <p>
        * Batch selection: By clicking on the select tool button, you can drag
        over a range of cells you want to use as input for computation, these
        cells will be colored differently to others, then you can drag over the
        range of cells where you want to store the result of the computaion,
        after which the functions pane will be visible for you to choose the
        function you want to apply.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are only a few maths functions implemented for now. The reader can
        reach out to me if there is any functions he requires to be added.
        Available functions are:
      </p>

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>sum</li>
          <li>subtract</li>
          <li>subtract reverse</li>
          <li>multiply</li>
          <li>average</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
